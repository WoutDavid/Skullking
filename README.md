## Skullking
by David Wouters

###Introduction
This repository contains code for my personal attempt at creating a java application that allows to play the board/cardgame "Skullking". 
The goal is to make this a webhosted java application where multiple players can come together to play the game, each on their seperate machine.

### Getting started
The application is not yet finished, so there is no way of running/installing anything just yet.
You can play with the classes by cloning the repo to your local machine and creating instances of the classes by using the main function.


### Disclaimer: 
This personal is for personal growth and enjoyment only. I have no intention of releasing this to be an actual game to the public or making money off of it, since I did not invent the game. It is merely an implementation.
