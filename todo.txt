- add starter to round
- somewhere in collecting cards and playing rotation, I'll have to make sure the order of the linked player array is correct, but i'll probably do this on game functionality, where I implement "picking cards"
- At some point you're gonna have to deal with green pirates
- checkWins and winscalling will have to be implemented somewhere, don't really know where ye
